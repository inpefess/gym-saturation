gym-saturation
==============

``gym-saturation`` is a collection of `Gymnasium
<https://gymnasium.farama.org/>`__ environments for reinforcement learning
(RL) agents striving to prove theorems. Currently, only theorems
written in `TPTP library <https://tptp.org>`__ formal language are
supported.

There are two environments in ``gym-saturation``: `VampireEnv <https://gym-saturation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments/vampire-env.html#vampire-env>`__ and
`IProverEnv <https://gym-saturation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments/iprover-env.html#iprover-env>`__. ``VampireEnv`` is a wrapper around a recent `Vampire
<https://github.com/vprover/vampire>`__ prover, and ``IProverEnv``
relies on an experimental version of `iProver
<https://gitlab.com/korovin/iprover/>`__.

In contrast to monolithic architecture of a typical Automated Theorem
Prover (ATP), ``gym-saturation`` gives different agents opportunities
to select clauses themselves and train from their experience.
Combined with a particular agent, ``gym-saturation`` can work as an
ATP.

``gym-saturation`` can be interesting for RL practitioners willing to
apply their experience to theorem proving without coding all the
logic-related stuff themselves. It also can be useful for automated
deduction researchers who want to create an RL-empowered ATP.

How to Install
==============

.. attention:: If you want to use ``VampireEnv`` you should have a
   Vampire binary on your machine. For example, download the
   latest `release
   <https://github.com/vprover/vampire/releases/tag/v4.7>`__.

   To use ``IProverEnv``, please build iProver from source using
   `this branch
   <https://gitlab.com/korovin/iprover/-/tree/2022_sockets>`__.

The best way to install this package is to use ``pip``:

.. code:: sh

   pip install gym-saturation

Another option is to use ``conda``:

.. code:: sh

   conda install -c conda-forge gym-saturation
   
One can also run it in a Docker container (with a pre-packed
``vampire`` binary):

.. code:: sh

   docker build -t gym-saturation https://github.com/inpefess/gym-saturation.git
   docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 gym-saturation jupyter-lab --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888

How to use
==========

One can use ``gym-saturation`` environments as any other Gymnasium environment:

.. code:: python

  import gym_saturation
  import gymnasium

  env = gymnasium.make("Vampire-v0")  # or "iProver-v0"
  # skip this line to use the default problem
  env.set_task("a-TPTP-problem-filename")
  observation, info = env.reset()
  terminated, truncated = False, False
  while not (terminated or truncated):
      # apply policy (a valid random action here)
      action = env.action_space.sample(mask=observation["action_mask"])
      observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
  env.close()

Or have a look at the basic `tutorial <https://gym-saturation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/auto_examples/plot_age_agent.html>`__.

How to Contribute
=================

`Pull requests <https://github.com/inpefess/gym-saturation/pulls>`__ are
welcome. To start:

.. code:: sh

   git clone https://github.com/inpefess/gym-saturation
   cd gym-saturation
   # activate python virtual environment with Python 3.8+
   pip install -U pip
   pip install -U setuptools wheel poetry
   poetry install
   # recommended but not necessary
   pre-commit install
   # install vampire binary
   wget https://github.com/vprover/vampire/releases/download/v4.7/vampire4.7.zip -O vampire.zip
   unzip vampire.zip
   # then use vampire_z3_rel_static_HEAD_6295 as an argument or add it to $PATH

All the tests in this package are
`doctests <https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html>`__. One can
run them with the following command:

.. code:: sh

   pytest --doctest-modules gym-saturation

To check the code quality before creating a pull request, one might run
the script ``local-build.sh``. It locally does nearly the same as the CI
pipeline after the PR is created.

Reporting issues or problems with the software
