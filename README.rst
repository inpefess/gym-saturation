gym-saturation
==============

``gym-saturation`` is an `OpenAI Gym <https://gym.openai.com/>`__
environment for reinforcement learning (RL) agents capable of proving
theorems. Currently, only theorems written in `TPTP
library <http://tptp.org>`__ formal language in clausal normal form
(CNF) are supported. ``gym-saturation`` implements the ‘given clause’
algorithm (similar to one used in
`Vampire <https://github.com/vprover/vampire>`__ and `E
Prover <https://github.com/eprover/eprover>`__). Being written in
Python, ``gym-saturation`` was inspired by
`PyRes <https://github.com/eprover/PyRes>`__. In contrast to monolithic
architecture of a typical Automated Theorem Prover (ATP),
``gym-saturation`` gives different agents opportunities to select
clauses themselves and train from their experience. Combined with a
particular agent, ``gym-saturation`` can work as an ATP.

``gym-saturation`` can be interesting for RL practitioners willing to
apply their experience to theorem proving without coding all the
logic-related stuff themselves. It also can be useful for automated
deduction researchers who want to create an RL-empowered ATP.

How to Install
==============

The best way to install this package is to use ``pip``:

.. code:: sh

   pip install gym-saturation

Another option is to use ``conda``:

.. code:: sh

   conda install -c conda-forge gym-saturation
   
One can also run it in a Docker container:

.. code:: sh

   docker build -t gym-saturation https://github.com/inpefess/gym-saturation.git
   docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 gym-saturation jupyter-lab --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888 --no-browser

How to use
==========

.. code:: python
	  
   import gym
   import os

   env = gym.make("GymSaturation-v0", problem_list=["..."])
   observation = env.reset()
   observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action)

See `the
notebook <https://github.com/inpefess/gym-saturation/blob/master/examples/example.ipynb>`__
or run it in
`Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/inpefess/gym-saturation/HEAD?labpath=example.ipynb>`__
for more information.

How to Contribute
=================

`Pull requests <https://github.com/inpefess/gym-saturation/pulls>`__ are
welcome. To start:

.. code:: sh

   git clone https://github.com/inpefess/gym-saturation
   cd gym-saturation
   # activate python virtual environment with Python 3.7+
   pip install -U pip
   pip install -U setuptools wheel poetry
   poetry install
   # recommended but not necessary
   pre-commit install

All the tests in this package are
`doctests <https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html>`__. One can
run them with the following command:

.. code:: sh

   pytest --doctest-modules gym-saturation

To check the code quality before creating a pull request, one might run
the script ``local-build.sh``. It locally does nearly the same as the CI
pipeline after the PR is created.

Reporting issues or problems with the software
==============================================

Questions and bug reports are welcome on `the
tracker <https://github.com/inpefess/gym-saturation/issues>`__.
